# Create: Tasty Snacks

**Create: Tasty Snacks** is a Minecraft mod that adds a variety of delicious snacks to the game, designed to work seamlessly with the [Create Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric). This is my first mod, so feedback is highly appreciated!

## Features

- **Sweeter Melon**: A tastier version of the melon that provides more hunger and saturation.
- **Lollipops**: A collection of colorful lollipops, each with unique effects:
  - **Red Lollipop**: Grants Regeneration.
  - **Blue Lollipop**: Grants Speed.
  - **Green Lollipop**: Grants Luck.

  - **Orange Lollipop**: Grants Fire Resistance.
  - **Warden Lollipop**: Applies Darkness.
  - **Bad Omen Lollipop**: Applies Bad Omen.

## Recipes

All lollipops are crafted using the **Create Mod's Mixing** mechanic. Each recipe requires:
